# Slack SPA

The goal of the Slack SPA widget is to allow a user access to the slack channels they are subscribed to, enable them to evaluate the sentiment of a team 'at a glance' and scroll and read through the messages of a given selected channel for further details.
When first using the widget, the user interface displays a login screen; following the initial login/authentication step, the users are able to select a channel from the pull-down menu on the toolbar and get 'at a glance' impression of the current sentiment of the team by looking at the sentiment analysis indicators (such as current color of the toolbar, background color for the message list and current emoji). Additionally, the users can scroll through the messages that are displayed inside the widget for further details. This tool offers a quick way for a manager or any team member to assess the current mood of the team and offer support in a timely fashion. Finally, the users can exit the message list view by logging out.
